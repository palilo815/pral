My Rust algorithm library, for use in programming competitions.

Most of the code here has been ported from my old [C++ library](https://github.com/palilo815/Team-Library).

# rustdoc

If you want to generate documentation, run this command:

```sh
cargo doc --document-private-items --no-deps --open
```
